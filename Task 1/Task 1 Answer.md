1. A customer informed their consultant that they have developed several formulations of petrol that gives different characteristics of burning pattern. The formulations are obtaining by adding varying levels of additives that, for example, prevent engine knocking, gum prevention, stability in storage, and etc. However, a third party certification organisation would like to verify if the formulations are significantly different, and request for both physical and statistical proof. Since the formulations are confidential information, they are not named in the dataset.


Please assist the consultant in the area of statistical analysis by doing this;


a. A descriptive analysis of the additives (columns named as “a” to “i”), which must include summaries of findings (parametric/non-parametric). Correlation and ANOVA, if applicable, is a must.

Summary:

> i. Size: 214 sample and 9 features

> ii. All features are continuous variable.

> iii. 


b. A graphical analysis of the additives, including a distribution study.


c. A clustering test of your choice (unsupervised learning), to determine the distinctive number of formulations present in the dataset.
